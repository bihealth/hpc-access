Users
=====

The user view is only for informational purposes for the user and serves as the plattform to accept invitations.
The user cannot make any request or change any attribute.
It consists of three tiles.

Account information
-------------------

1. The first tile contains all the information about the user.
2. The second tile contains the information about the group you are part of.
3. The third tile lists all the projects you are assigned to.

Accept a group invitation
-------------------------

When you do not have a cluster account and your PI has invited you to his group, you receive an invitation per mail once the HPC administrators have confirmed the request.
To accept the invitation, log in to the application with your Charite or MDC credentials and a consent page will show up.
After your confirmation, your account will be created and you are accepted to the group.

Accept a project invitation
---------------------------

When you have been invited to a project, it will be listed in the right-hand tile in the projects list.
Before becoming a member of the project, you have to accept the invitation.
