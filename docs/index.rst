HPC Access Manual
=================

HPC Access is a user access management system, developed for the `BIH HPC Cluster <http://hpc.bihealth.org/>`.
It provides users with an overview of the data they have access to and informs them about quota usage.
Principal investigators and group delegates can use HPC access to make resource requests to the administrators of the cluster.
