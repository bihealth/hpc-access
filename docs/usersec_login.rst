Login & Access
==============

You will be greeted with a login screen when you access the application and are not logged in.

    Use your MDC or Charite credentials to log in.

Depending on different factors, the page after login will look different.
This section describes this in more detail.

Visitor without cluster account
-------------------------------

If you do not have a cluster account yet, a form will be displayed where you can request a group on the cluster.
This is intended for PIs only, and at that point we don't know whether you are PI or not.

.. important::

    Please do apply only if you are known to Charite or MDC as PI and if you have evidence for that (a lab website for example).

If you are a user, please read the `HPC documentation <https://hpc-docs.bihealth.org>`_ on how to get access.
In short, talk to your PI, s/he is the only one eligible to create the group and request your access, or the delegate, if the group already exists and one is named.
